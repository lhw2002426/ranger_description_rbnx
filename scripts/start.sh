# Start phase. Two steps:
#   1. RegisterPrimitive on atlas — so rbnx boot's wait_for_registration
#      loop unblocks and the package shows up under `rbnx caps`.
#   2. exec ros2 launch via a tiny Python wrapper that holds the atlas
#      gRPC channel open + heartbeats every 30s while ros2 launch runs
#      as its child.
#
# We do BOTH in `scripts/atlas_register_and_launch.py` (one process,
# minimal lines) instead of stringing together two shells. See that
# file's header for why we don't use robonix_api / @on_init / a driver
# contract — short version: TF is a global ROS 2 side-channel, so we
# don't need atlas to route it; we only need atlas to know we exist
# so rbnx boot's bring-up sequence proceeds.
